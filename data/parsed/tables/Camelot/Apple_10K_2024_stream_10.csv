"The  Company  depends  on  component  and  product  manufacturing  and  logistical  services  provided  by  outsourcing  partners,  many  of  which  are"
"located outside of the U.S."
"Substantially  all  of  the  Company’s  manufacturing  is  performed  in  whole  or  in  part  by  outsourcing  partners  located  primarily  in  China  mainland,  India,  Japan,"
"South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often"
"in  single  locations.  The  Company  has  also  outsourced  much  of  its  transportation  and  logistics  management.  While  these  arrangements  can  lower  operating"
"costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have"
"an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing"
"conditions.  Although  arrangements  with  these  partners  may  contain  provisions  for  product  defect  expense  reimbursement,  the  Company  generally  remains"
"responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from"
"time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time"
"and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition."
"The  Company  relies  on  single-source  outsourcing  partners  in  the  U.S., Asia  and  Europe  to  supply  and  manufacture  many  components,  and  on  outsourcing"
"partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a"
"negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final"
"destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes,"
"economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, or conflict."
"The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to"
"certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if"
"these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be disrupted or"
"terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted."
"Changes or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties, including exposure"
"to additional regulatory and operational risks."
"Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms."
"Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many"
"components,  including  those  that  are  available  from  multiple  sources,  are  at  times  subject  to  industry-wide  shortages  and  significant  commodity  pricing"
"fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor"
"industry  has  in  the  past  experienced  high  demand  and  shortages  of  supply,  which  adversely  affected  the  Company’s  ability  to  obtain  sufficient  quantities  of"
"components  and  products  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  or  at  all.  Such  disruptions  could  occur  in  the  future.  While  the  Company  has  entered  into"
"agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or"
"at  all.  In  addition,  component  suppliers  may  suffer  from  poor  financial  conditions,  which  can  lead  to  business  failure  for  the  supplier  or  consolidation  within  a"
"particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the"
"Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and"
"financial condition."
"The  Company’s  new  products  often  utilize  custom  components  available  from  only  one  source.  When  a  component  or  product  uses  new  technologies,  initial"
"capacity  constraints  may  exist  until  the  suppliers’  yields  have  matured  or  their  manufacturing  capacities  have  increased.  The  continued  availability  of  these"
"components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common"
"components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product"
"has  been  delayed  or  constrained,  or  when  an  outsourcing  partner  has  delayed  shipments  of  completed  products  to  the  Company,  the  Company’s  business,"
"results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  have  been  adversely  affected  and  future  delays  or  constraints  could  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company’s"
"business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  The  Company’s  business  and  financial  performance  could  also  be  materially  adversely  affected"
"depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source."
