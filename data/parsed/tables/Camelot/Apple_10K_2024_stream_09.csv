"Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be"
"unable to compete effectively in these markets."
"The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward"
"pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in"
"product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and"
"businesses."
"The  Company’s  ability  to  compete  successfully  depends  heavily  on  ensuring  the  continuing  and  timely  introduction  of  innovative  new  products,  services  and"
"technologies  to  the  marketplace.  The  Company  designs  and  develops  nearly  the  entire  solution  for  its  products,  including  the  hardware,  operating  system,"
"numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these"
"investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully."
"The  Company  currently  holds  a  significant  number  of  patents,  trademarks  and  copyrights  and  has  registered,  and  applied  to  register,  additional  patents,"
"trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,"
"and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every"
"country  in  which  the  Company  operates.  If  the  Company  is  unable  to  continue  to  develop  and  sell  innovative  new  products  with  attractive  margins  or  if"
"competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected."
"The  Company  has  a  minority  market  share  in  the  global  smartphone,  personal  computer  and  tablet  markets.  The  Company  faces  substantial  competition  in"
"these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital"
"content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of"
"active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have"
"the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have"
"from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall."
"Additionally,  the  Company  faces  significant  competition  as  competitors  imitate  the  Company’s  product  features  and  applications  within  their  products  or"
"collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate"
"the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions."
"The  Company’s  services  also  face  substantial  competition,  including  from  companies  that  have  significant  resources  and  experience  and  have  established"
"service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes"
"with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications."
"The  Company’s  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  depend  substantially  on  the  Company’s  ability  to  continually  improve  its  products  and"
"services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services"
"that compete effectively."
"Business Risks"
"To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products"
"and services."
"Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new"
"products,  services  and  technologies,  enhance  existing  products  and  services,  effectively  stimulate  customer  demand  for  new  and  upgraded  products  and"
"services,  and  successfully  manage  the  transition  to  these  new  and  upgraded  products  and  services.  The  success  of  new  product  and  service  introductions"
"depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with"
"new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software or other third-party support for the Company’s products and services,"
"the  effective  management  of  purchase  commitments  and  inventory  levels  in  line  with  anticipated  product  demand,  the  availability  of  products  in  appropriate"
"quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. New"
"products, services and technologies may replace or supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins, which can materially"
"adversely  impact  the  Company’s  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  There  can  be  no  assurance  the  Company  will  successfully  manage"
"future introductions and transitions of products and services."
