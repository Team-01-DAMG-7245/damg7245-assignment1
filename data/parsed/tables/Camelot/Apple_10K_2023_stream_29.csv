"Capital Return Program"
"In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to"
"acquire  a  minimum  amount  of  shares.  As  of  September  30,  2023,  the  Company’s  quarterly  cash  dividend  was  $0.24  per  share.  The  Company  intends  to"
"increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors."
"Critical Accounting Estimates"
"The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s"
"discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that"
"affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this"
"Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management"
"bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form"
"the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities."
"Uncertain Tax Positions"
"The  Company  is  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  U.S.  and  numerous  foreign  jurisdictions.  The  evaluation  of  the  Company’s  uncertain  tax  positions  involves"
"significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the"
"allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given"
"that  the  final  outcome  of  these  uncertainties  will  not  be  different  from  that  which  is  reflected  in  the  Company’s  reserves.  Reserves  are  adjusted  considering"
"changing  facts  and  circumstances,  such  as  the  closing  of  a  tax  examination.  Resolution  of  these  uncertainties  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  management’s"
"expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results."
"Legal and Other Contingencies"
"The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain."
"The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires"
"significant  judgment.  Resolution  of  legal  matters  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  management’s  expectations  could  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company’s"
"financial condition and operating results."
