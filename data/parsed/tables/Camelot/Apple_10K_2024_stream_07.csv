"Item 1A.    Risk Factors"
"The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known"
"or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of"
"operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected."

"This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements."

"The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can"
"materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition."
"The  Company  has  international  operations  with  sales  outside  the  U.S.  representing  a  majority  of  the  Company’s  total  net  sales.  In  addition,  the  Company’s"
"global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the"
"U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions."
"Adverse  macroeconomic  conditions,  including  slow  growth  or  recession,  high  unemployment,  inflation,  tighter  credit,  higher  interest  rates,  and  currency"
"fluctuations,  can  adversely  impact  consumer  confidence  and  spending  and  materially  adversely  affect  demand  for  the  Company’s  products  and  services.  In"
"addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility,"
"declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors."
"In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions"
"can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel"
"partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency."
"Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties"
"and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial"
"instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price."
