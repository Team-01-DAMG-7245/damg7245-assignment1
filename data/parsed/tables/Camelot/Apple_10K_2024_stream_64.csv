"Description of the Matter"
"As  discussed  in  Note  7  to  the  financial  statements,  the  Company  is  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  U.S.  and"
"numerous foreign jurisdictions. As of September 28, 2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was"
"$22.0 billion, of which $10.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. In accounting for"

"GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws."
"Auditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and"

"on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings."
