"Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks"
"The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or"
"government investigations."
"The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet"
"been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions"
"which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and"
"government  investigations  involving  the  Company,  and  the  alleged  magnitude  of  such  claims,  proceedings  and  government  investigations,  has  generally"
"increased over time and may continue to increase."
"The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the"
"future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents"
"and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is"
"vigorously  defending  infringement  actions  in  courts  in  several  U.S.  jurisdictions,  as  well  as  internationally  in  various  countries.  The  plaintiffs  in  these  actions"
"frequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages."
"Regardless  of  the  merit  of  particular  claims,  defending  against  litigation  or  responding  to  government  investigations  can  be  expensive,  time-consuming  and"
"disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation"
"and  resolve  such  challenges.  There  can  be  no  assurance  such  agreements  can  be  obtained  on  acceptable  terms  or  that  litigation  will  not  occur.  These"
"agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and"
"limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services."
"The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified"
"third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting"
"period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial"
"corporate  measures  or  injunctive  relief  against  the  Company,  and  has  from  time  to  time  required,  and  can  in  the  future  require,  the  Company  to  change  its"
"business  practices  and  limit  the  Company’s  ability  to  develop,  manufacture,  use,  import  or  offer  for  sale  certain  products  and  services,  all  of  which  could"
"materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition."
"While  the  Company  maintains  insurance  coverage  for  certain  types  of  claims,  such  insurance  coverage  may  be  insufficient  to  cover  all  losses  or  all  types  of"
"claims that may arise."
"The  Company  is  subject  to  complex  and  changing  laws  and  regulations  worldwide,  which  exposes  the  Company  to  potential  liabilities,  increased"
"costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business."
"The  Company’s  global  operations  are  subject  to  complex  and  changing  laws  and  regulations  on  subjects,  including  antitrust;  privacy,  data  security  and  data"
"localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership"
"and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film"
"and  digital  content;  availability  of  third-party  software  applications  and  services;  labor  and  employment;  anticorruption;  import,  export  and  trade;  foreign"
"exchange  controls  and  cash  repatriation  restrictions;  anti–money  laundering;  foreign  ownership  and  investment;  tax;  and  environmental,  health  and  safety,"
"including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change."
"Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by"
"increasing  the  Company’s  costs,  limiting  the  Company’s  ability  to  offer  a  product,  service  or  feature  to  customers,  imposing  changes  to  the  design  of  the"
"Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s business or"
"supply chain. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These"
"risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as"
"the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical"
"considerations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and"
"regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies"
"and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of"
"operations and financial condition."
