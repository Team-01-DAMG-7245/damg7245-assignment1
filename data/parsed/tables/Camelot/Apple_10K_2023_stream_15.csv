"Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by"

"Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain"
"and  its  business.  New  and  changing  laws  and  regulations  can  also  create  uncertainty  about  how  such  laws  and  regulations  will  be  interpreted  and  applied."

"notice  and  the  Company  may  not  be  able  to  effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  For  example,  the  Company  is  subject  to  changing"
"regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy"
"regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a"

"Expectations  relating  to  environmental,  social  and  governance  considerations  and  related  reporting  obligations  expose  the  Company  to  potential"

"Many  governments,  regulators,  investors,  employees,  customers  and  other  stakeholders  are  increasingly  focused  on  environmental,  social  and  governance"

"The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes"

"From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal"
"and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the"

"have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also"
