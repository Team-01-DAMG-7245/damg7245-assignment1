"The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue"
"they  generate  on  the  App  Store.  The  Company  retains  a  commission  from  sales  of  applications  and  sales  of  digital  services  or  goods  initiated  within  an"
"application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal"
"and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the"
"App Store, such as the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject"
"to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in"
"further  changes.  Changes  have  included  how  developers  communicate  with  consumers  outside  the App  Store  regarding  alternative  purchasing  mechanisms."
"Future  changes  could  also  affect  what  the  Company  charges  developers  for  access  to  its  platforms,  how  it  manages  distribution  of  apps  outside  of  the App"
"Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This"
"could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company"
"retains  on  such  sales  is  reduced,  or  if  it  is  otherwise  narrowed  in  scope  or  eliminated,  the  Company’s  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition"
"could be materially adversely affected."
"Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable"
"terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition."
"The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party"
"content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can"
"be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some"
"third-party  content  providers  and  distributors  currently  or  in  the  future  may  offer  competing  products  and  services,  and  can  take  actions  to  make  it  difficult  or"
"impossible  for  the  Company  to  license  or  otherwise  distribute  their  content.  Other  content  owners,  providers  or  distributors  may  seek  to  limit  the  Company’s"
"access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices"
"with acceptable usage rules."
"The  Company  also  produces  its  own  digital  content,  which  can  be  costly  to  produce  due  to  intense  and  increasing  competition  for  talent,  content  and"
"subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers."
"Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the"
"Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license"
"such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner."
"The  Company’s  success  depends  largely  on  the  talents  and  efforts  of  its  team  members,  the  continued  service  and  availability  of  highly  skilled"
"employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture."
"Much  of  the  Company’s  future  success  depends  on  the  talents  and  efforts  of  its  team  members  and  the  continued  availability  and  service  of  key  personnel,"
"including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand"
"and  competition  for  their  talents  is  intense,  especially  in  Silicon  Valley,  where  most  of  the  Company’s  key  personnel  are  located.  In  addition  to  intense"
"competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially"
"adversely affect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational flexibility."
"The  Company  believes  that  its  distinctive  and  inclusive  culture  is  a  significant  driver  of  its  success.  If  the  Company  is  unable  to  nurture  its  culture,  it  could"
"materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially"
"adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition."
"The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers."
"The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute"
"products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to"
"consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force."
"Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the"
"device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts."
