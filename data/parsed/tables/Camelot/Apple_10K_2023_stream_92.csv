"The holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of any series may, on behalf of the holders of all Notes of that"
"series, waive compliance by us with certain restrictive provisions of the Indentures. The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the"
"outstanding Notes of a series may, on behalf of the holders of all Notes of that series, waive any past default and its consequences under the applicable"
"Indenture with respect to the Notes of that series, except a default (1) in the payment of principal or premium, if any, or interest on Notes of that series or (2) in"
"respect of a covenant or provision of the applicable Indenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each Note of that series."
"Upon any such waiver, such default will cease to exist, and any event of default arising therefrom will be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of the"
"Indenture; however, no such waiver will extend to any subsequent or other default or event of default or impair any rights consequent thereon."
"Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance"
"We may discharge certain obligations to holders of the Notes of a series that have not already been delivered to the trustee for cancellation and that"
"either have become due and payable or will become due and payable within one year (or scheduled for redemption within one year) by depositing with the"
"trustee, in trust, funds in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness including, but not limited to, the principal and premium, if any, and"
"interest to the date of such deposit (if due and payable) or to the maturity thereof or the redemption date of the Notes of that series, as the case may be. We may"
"direct the trustee to invest such funds in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of one year or less or in a money market fund that invests solely in short-term"
"U.S. Treasury securities."
"The Indentures provide that we may elect either (1) to defease and be discharged from any and all obligations with respect to the Notes of a series"
"(except for, among other things, obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the Notes, to replace temporary or mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes,"
"to maintain an office or agency with respect to the Notes and to hold moneys for payment in trust) (“legal defeasance”) or (2) to be released from our obligations"
"to comply with the restrictive covenants under the applicable Indenture, and any omission to comply with such obligations will not constitute a default or an event"
"of default with respect to the Notes of a series and clauses (3) and (6) under the caption “Events of Default” above will no longer be applied (“covenant"
"defeasance”). Legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, will be conditioned upon, among other things, the irrevocable deposit by us with"
"the trustee, in trust, of an amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. government obligations (as such term is modified below), or both, applicable to the Notes of that series"
"which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient to pay the principal or"
"premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the scheduled due dates therefor."
"If we effect covenant defeasance with respect to the Notes of any series, the amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. government obligations (as such term is"
"modified below), or both, on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants, to pay amounts"
"due on the Notes of that series at the time of the stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at the time of the"
"acceleration resulting from such event of default. However, we would remain liable to make payment of such amounts due at the time of acceleration."
"With respect to the 2024 Notes, the 0.000% 2025 Notes, the 0.875% 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the"
"2031 Notes, the term “U.S. government obligations” shall instead mean (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the German government or (ii) an"
"obligation of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the German government the payment of which is fully and"
"unconditionally guaranteed by the German government or the central bank of the German government, which, in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or"
"redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) certificates, depositary receipts or other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest in"
