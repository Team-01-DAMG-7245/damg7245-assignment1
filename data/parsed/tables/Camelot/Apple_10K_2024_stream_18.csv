"The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies."
"The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses"
"worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the"
"past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations."
"The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and"
"earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for"
"competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect"
"the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales."
"Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and"
"earnings,  could  cause  the  Company  to  reduce  international  pricing  or  incur  losses  on  its  foreign  currency  derivative  instruments,  thereby  limiting  the  benefit."
"Additionally,  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  may  increase  the  Company’s  cost  of  product  components  denominated  in  those  currencies,  thus  adversely"
"affecting gross margins."
"The  Company  uses  derivative  instruments,  such  as  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts,  to  hedge  certain  exposures  to  fluctuations  in  foreign"
"exchange  rates. The  use  of  such  hedging  activities  may  not  be  effective  to  offset  any,  or  more  than  a  portion,  of  the  adverse  financial  effects  of  unfavorable"
"movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place."
"The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio."
"The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political"
"risk,  sovereign  risk,  interest  rate  fluctuations  or  other  factors.  As  a  result,  the  value  and  liquidity  of  the  Company’s  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable"
"securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not realized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future"
"fluctuations  in  their  value  could  result  in  significant  losses  and  could  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the  Company’s  results  of  operations  and  financial"
"condition."
"The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply"
"agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen."
"The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company"
"also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the"
"Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant"
"portion  of  the  Company’s  trade  receivables  can  be  concentrated  within  cellular  network  carriers  or  other  resellers.  The  Company’s  exposure  to  credit  and"
"collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has"
"unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or"
"assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of"
"inventory components. As of September 28, 2024, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were"
"concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its"
"trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and"
"avoid losses."
"The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities."
"The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries"
"are  organized.  Due  to  economic  and  political  conditions,  tax  laws  and  tax  rates  for  income  taxes  and  other  non-income  taxes  in  various  jurisdictions  may  be"
"subject  to  significant  change.  For  example,  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  continues  to  advance  proposals  for  modernizing"
"international  tax  rules,  including  the  introduction  of  global  minimum  tax  standards.  The  Company’s  effective  tax  rates  are  affected  by  changes  in  the  mix  of"
"earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes"
"in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations."
