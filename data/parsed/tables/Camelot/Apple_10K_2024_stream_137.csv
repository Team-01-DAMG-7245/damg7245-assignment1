"Restricted Trading Periods and Trading Windows"
"A restricted trading period is a specified period of time during which designated Apple personnel, and their covered family members and"
"entities, may not buy or sell Apple securities. If you are subject to trading restrictions, you will be notified by Apple’s Corporate Legal team."
"A trading window (sometimes referred to as an “open trading window”) is a specified period of time during which Apple personnel may buy or"
"sell Apple securities, so long as the individual is not aware of material nonpublic information. Complying with restricted trading periods and"
"trading windows may protect you and Apple from regulatory investigations or insider trading allegations. However, even if you are not subject"
"to restricted trading periods or no such period is in effect, you must not trade in Apple securities if you are aware of material nonpublic"
"information about Apple."
"The regularly scheduled restricted trading period and trading window for each quarter is indicated below."
