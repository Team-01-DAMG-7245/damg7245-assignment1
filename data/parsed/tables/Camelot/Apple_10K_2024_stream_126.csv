"5.    Dividend and Voting Rights."
"(a)    Limitations on Rights Associated with RSUs. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no"
"dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the"
"RSUs  or  any  Shares  underlying  or  issuable  in  respect  of  such  RSUs  until  such  Shares  are  actually  issued  to  and  held  of  record  by  the"
"Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the"
"Shares as reflected in the book entry evidencing such Shares."
"(b)        Dividend  Equivalent  Rights.  As  of  any  date  that  the  Company  pays  an  ordinary  cash  dividend  on  its  Shares,  the"
"Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such"
"date, multiplied by (ii) the total target number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the Award"
"that are outstanding on the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”). Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to"
"the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the"
"original RSUs to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the amount of any vested"
"Dividend  Equivalent  Rights  shall  be  paid  in  cash.  For  purposes  of  clarity,  the  percentage  of  the  Dividend  Equivalent  Rights  that  are  paid  will"
"correspond to the percentage of the total target number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date, after giving effect to Exhibit A. No crediting of"
"Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which, as of the record date for that dividend,"
"have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit A."

"interest  therein  or  amount  or  Shares  issued  in  respect  thereof  shall  not  be  sold,  assigned,  transferred,  pledged  or  otherwise  disposed  of,"
"alienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily."
"7.    Timing and Manner of Settlement of RSUs. On or as soon as administratively practical following the Vesting Date pursuant to"
"Section 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 ½) months after such Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the"
"Participant  a  number  of  Shares  equal  to  the  number  of  RSUs  subject  to  the  Award  that  vest  on  such  vesting  event  (or,  in  the  case  of  the"
"Participant’s Retirement, death or Disability, are scheduled to settle on such vesting event), less Tax-Related Items, unless such RSUs terminate"
"prior to the Vesting Date pursuant to Section 8. The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise settle vested RSUs is subject to the"
"condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested RSUs deliver to"
"the Company any representations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have"
"no further rights with respect to any RSUs that are settled or that are forfeited pursuant to Section 8."
