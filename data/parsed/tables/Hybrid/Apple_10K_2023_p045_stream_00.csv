European Commission State Aid Decision
"On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and"
2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered
"Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of"
"January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2"
billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On
"July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to"
"the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company"
believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid
Decision.
"On  an  annual  basis,  the  Company  may  request  approval  from  the  Irish  Minister  for  Finance  to  reduce  the  recovery  amount  for  certain  taxes  paid  to  other"
"countries. As of September 30, 2023, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded"
"into  escrow,  where  it  will  remain  restricted  from  general  use  pending  the  conclusion  of  all  legal  proceedings.  Refer  to  the  Cash,  Cash  Equivalents  and"
"Marketable Securities section of Note 4, “Financial Instruments” for more information."
Note 8 – Leases
"The  Company  has  lease  arrangements  for  certain  equipment  and  facilities,  including  corporate,  data  center,  manufacturing  and  retail  space.  These  leases"
"typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise."
"Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the"
"underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion for 2023,"
"2022 and 2021, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $13.9 billion, $14.9 billion and $12.9 billion for 2023,"
"2022 and 2021, respectively."
"The Company made $1.9 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Noncash"
"activities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $2.1 billion, $2.8 billion and $3.3 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021,"
respectively.
"The  following  table  shows  ROU  assets  and  lease  liabilities,  and  the  associated  financial  statement  line  items,  as  of  September  30,  2023  and  September  24,"
