"The  Company  has  invested  and  will  continue  to  invest  in  programs  to  enhance  reseller  sales,  including  staffing  selected  resellers’  stores  with  Company"
"employees  and  contractors,  and  improving  product  placement  displays.  These  programs  can  require  a  substantial  investment  while  not  assuring  return  or"
"incremental  sales.  The  financial  condition  of  these  resellers  could  weaken,  these  resellers  could  stop  distributing  the  Company’s  products,  or  uncertainty"
regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.
The Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.
The Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures
"or  network  disruptions  caused  by  natural  disasters,  accidents,  power  disruptions,  telecommunications  failures,  acts  of  terrorism  or  war,  computer  viruses,"
"physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity"
"measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all"
"eventualities.  Such  failures  or  disruptions  can  adversely  impact  the  Company’s  business  by,  among  other  things,  preventing  access  to  the  Company’s  online"
"services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely"
"affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition."
"Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant"
"reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences."
"The  Company’s  business  requires  it  to  use  and  store  confidential  information,  including  personal  information,  with  respect  to  the  Company’s  customers  and"
"employees.  The  Company  devotes  significant  resources  to  network  and  data  security,  including  through  the  use  of  encryption  and  other  security  measures"
"intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential"
"information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition."
The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are
also  exposed  to  ransomware  and  other  malicious  attacks  that  can  disrupt  business  operations.  Although  the  Company  takes  steps  to  secure  confidential
"information  that  is  provided  to  or  accessible  by  third  parties  working  on  the  Company’s  behalf,  such  measures  are  not  always  effective  and  losses  or"
"unauthorized  access  to,  or  releases  of,  confidential  information  occur.  Such  incidents  and  other  malicious  attacks  could  materially  adversely  affect  the"
"Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition."
The  Company  experiences  malicious  attacks  and  other  attempts  to  gain  unauthorized  access  to  its  systems  on  a  regular  basis.  These  attacks  seek  to
"compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the"
"Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships,"
"and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks"
are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent
"controls,  avoid  detection,  and  remove  or  obfuscate  forensic  evidence,  all  of  which  hinders  the  Company’s  ability  to  identify,  investigate  and  recover  from"
"incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict."
"Although  malicious  attacks  perpetrated  to  gain  access  to  confidential  information,  including  personal  information,  affect  many  companies  across  various"
"industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns,"
"manages, stores and processes."
The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of
"sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies,"
"these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system"
"error,  faulty  password  management  or  other  irregularities.  For  example,  third  parties  can  fraudulently  induce  the  Company’s  or  its  vendors’  employees  or"
"customers  into  disclosing  usernames,  passwords  or  other  sensitive  information,  which  can,  in  turn,  be  used  for  unauthorized  access  to  the  Company’s  or  its"
"vendors’  systems  and  services.  To  help  protect  customers  and  the  Company,  the  Company  deploys  and  makes  available  technologies  like  multifactor"
"authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can"
result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.
"While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient"
to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.
