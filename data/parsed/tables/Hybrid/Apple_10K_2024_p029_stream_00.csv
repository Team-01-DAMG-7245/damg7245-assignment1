Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Income Taxes
"In  December  2023,  the  Financial Accounting  Standards  Board  (the  “FASB”)  issued Accounting  Standards  Update  (“ASU”)  No.  2023-09,  Income  Taxes  (Topic"
"740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax"
rate  reconciliation  and  provide  additional  information  for  reconciling  items  that  meet  a  quantitative  threshold. ASU  2023-09  will  also  require  the  Company  to
"disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The"
Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method.
Segment Reporting
"In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”),"
which  will  require  the  Company  to  disclose  segment  expenses  that  are  significant  and  regularly  provided  to  the  Company’s  chief  operating  decision  maker
"(“CODM”). In addition, ASU 2023-07 will require the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss"
information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using
a retrospective transition method.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s
"discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that"
"affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this"
Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management
"bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form"
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The  Company  is  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  U.S.  and  numerous  foreign  jurisdictions.  The  evaluation  of  the  Company’s  uncertain  tax  positions  involves
"significant  judgment  in  the  interpretation  and  application  of  GAAP  and  complex  domestic  and  international  tax  laws,  including  the TCJA  and  the  allocation  of"
"international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final"
outcome  of  these  uncertainties  will  not  be  different  from  that  reflected  in  the  Company’s  reserves.  Reserves  are  adjusted  considering  changing  facts  and
"circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have"
a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.
Legal and Other Contingencies
"The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain."
"The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires"
significant  judgment.  Resolution  of  legal  matters  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  management’s  expectations  could  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company’s
financial condition and operating results.
