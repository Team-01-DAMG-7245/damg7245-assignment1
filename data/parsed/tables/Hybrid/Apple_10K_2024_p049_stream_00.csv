Contingencies
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The
"outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a"
"material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims."
Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product
"Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from"
"single  or  limited  sources.  The  Company  also  competes  for  various  components  with  other  participants  in  the  markets  for  smartphones,  personal  computers,"
"tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times"
subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.
"The  Company  uses  some  custom  components  that  are  not  commonly  used  by  its  competitors,  and  new  products  introduced  by  the  Company  often  utilize"
"custom  components  available  from  only  one  source.  When  a  component  or  product  uses  new  technologies,  initial  capacity  constraints  may  exist  until  the"
"suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,"
may  be  affected  if  suppliers  decide  to  concentrate  on  the  production  of  common  components  instead  of  components  customized  to  meet  the  Company’s
requirements.
"Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South"
"Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam."
Note 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data
"The  Company  manages  its  business  primarily  on  a  geographic  basis.  The  Company’s  reportable  segments  consist  of  the Americas,  Europe,  Greater  China,"
"Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and"
"Africa.  Greater  China  includes  China  mainland,  Hong  Kong  and Taiwan.  Rest  of Asia  Pacific  includes Australia  and  those Asian  countries  not  included  in  the"
"Company’s  other  reportable  segments. Although  the  reportable  segments  provide  similar  hardware  and  software  products  and  similar  services,  each  one  is"
managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic
region.
The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally
based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment
"consists  of  net  sales  to  third  parties,  related  cost  of  sales,  and  operating  expenses  directly  attributable  to  the  segment.  The  information  provided  to  the"
Company’s chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.
