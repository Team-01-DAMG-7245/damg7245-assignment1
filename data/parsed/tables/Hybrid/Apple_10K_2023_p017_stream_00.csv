"The  Company  is  also  currently  subject  to  antitrust  investigations  in  various  jurisdictions  around  the  world,  which  can  result  in  legal  proceedings  and  claims"
"against  the  Company  that  could,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  have  a  materially  adverse  impact  on  the  Company’s  business,  results  of  operations  and"
"financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such"
"investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its"
"App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also"
"subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes."
"Further,  the  Company  has  commercial  relationships  with  other  companies  in  the  technology  industry  that  are  or  may  become  subject  to  investigations  and"
"litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners"
"and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing"
"arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently"
subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.
"There  can  be  no  assurance  the  Company’s  business  will  not  be  materially  adversely  affected,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  by  the  outcomes  of  such"
"investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations"
or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely
"affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor"
"market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales."
"The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection."
"The Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various"
"types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the"
"Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional"
restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and
changing  requirements  causes  the  Company  to  incur  substantial  costs  and  has  required  and  may  in  the  future  require  the  Company  to  change  its  business
practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.
"The  Company  makes  statements  about  its  use  and  disclosure  of  personal  information  through  its  privacy  policy,  information  provided  on  its  website,  press"
"statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or"
international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In
"addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability."
"In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific"
"obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial"
"data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding"
"the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data"
"is  handled  in  a  manner  not  permitted  by  law  or  under  the  Company’s  agreements  with  healthcare  or  financial  institutions,  the  Company  can  be  subject  to"
"litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines."
"Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised,"
the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry
data  security  standards. The  Company  could  also  experience  a  significant  increase  in  payment  card  transaction  costs  or  lose  the  ability  to  process  payment
"cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of"
operations and financial condition.
