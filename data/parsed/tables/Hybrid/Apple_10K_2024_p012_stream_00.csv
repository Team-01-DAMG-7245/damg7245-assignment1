The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect
the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.
The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating
"system  software  and  applications,  such  as  those  offered  by  the  Company,  often  have  issues  that  can  unexpectedly  interfere  with  the  intended  operation  of"
hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects
could  make  the  Company’s  products  unsafe  and  create  a  risk  of  environmental  or  property  damage  and  personal  injury.  These  risks  may  increase  as  the
"Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from"
"time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and may"
"not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety"
"risks, including exposing users to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect"
"and  fix  all  issues  and  defects  in  the  hardware,  software  and  services  it  offers.  Failure  to  do  so  can  result  in  widespread  technical  and  performance  issues"
"affecting  the  Company’s  products  and  services.  Errors,  bugs  and  vulnerabilities  can  be  exploited  by  third  parties,  compromising  the  safety  and  security  of  a"
"user’s  device.  In  addition,  the  Company  can  be  exposed  to  product  liability  claims,  recalls,  product  replacements  or  modifications,  write-offs  of  inventory,"
"property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems"
"can  adversely  affect  the  experience  for  users  of  the  Company’s  products  and  services,  and  result  in  harm  to  the  Company’s  reputation,  loss  of  competitive"
"advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales."
"The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation"
risk.
"The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds"
net  realizable  value. The  Company  also  accrues  necessary  cancellation  fee  reserves  for  orders  of  excess  products  and  components. The  Company  reviews
"long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate"
"the  assets  may  not  be  recoverable.  If  the  Company  determines  that  an  impairment  has  occurred,  it  records  a  write-down  equal  to  the  amount  by  which  the"
"carrying  value  of  the  asset  exceeds  its  fair  value. Although  the  Company  believes  its  inventory,  capital  assets,  inventory  prepayments  and  other  assets  and"
"purchase  commitments  are  currently  recoverable,  there  can  be  no  assurance  the  Company  will  not  incur  write-downs,  fees,  impairments  and  other  charges"
given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.
The  Company  orders  components  for  its  products  and  builds  inventory  in  advance  of  product  announcements  and  shipments.  Manufacturing  purchase
"obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets"
"are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or"
"insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments."
"The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms, or"
at all.
"The Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In"
"addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent"
"coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property"
"rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties."
"Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially"
"reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the"
"right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain"
"products, services or features or preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s"
"business, results of operations and financial condition."
