Financial Risks
The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.
"The  Company’s  profit  margins  vary  across  its  products,  services,  geographic  segments  and  distribution  channels.  For  example,  the  gross  margins  on  the"
Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure
"due  to  a  variety  of  factors,  including:  continued  industry-wide  global  product  pricing  pressures  and  product  pricing  actions  that  the  Company  may  take  in"
response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed
"product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering"
"content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or"
"in  the  geographic,  currency  or  channel  mix,  including  to  the  extent  that  regulatory  changes  require  the  Company  to  modify  its  product  and  service  offerings;"
"fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or"
services  with  higher  cost  structures.  These  and  other  factors  could  have  a  materially  adverse  impact  on  the  Company’s  results  of  operations  and  financial
condition.
The  Company  has  historically  experienced  higher  net  sales  in  its  first  quarter  compared  to  other  quarters  in  its  fiscal  year  due  in  part  to  seasonal  holiday
"demand. Additionally,  new  product  and  service  introductions  can  significantly  impact  net  sales,  cost  of  sales  and  operating  expenses.  Further,  the  Company"
generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The
"Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new"
"product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply,"
or manufacturing partners.
The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.
"The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses"
worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the
past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and
"earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for"
"competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect"
the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.
"Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and"
"earnings,  could  cause  the  Company  to  reduce  international  pricing  or  incur  losses  on  its  foreign  currency  derivative  instruments,  thereby  limiting  the  benefit."
"Additionally,  strengthening  of  foreign  currencies  may  increase  the  Company’s  cost  of  product  components  denominated  in  those  currencies,  thus  adversely"
affecting gross margins.
"The  Company  uses  derivative  instruments,  such  as  foreign  currency  forward  and  option  contracts,  to  hedge  certain  exposures  to  fluctuations  in  foreign"
"exchange  rates. The  use  of  such  hedging  activities  may  not  be  effective  to  offset  any,  or  more  than  a  portion,  of  the  adverse  financial  effects  of  unfavorable"
movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.
The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.
"The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political"
"risk,  sovereign  risk,  interest  rate  fluctuations  or  other  factors.  As  a  result,  the  value  and  liquidity  of  the  Company’s  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable"
"securities  may  fluctuate  substantially. Therefore,  although  the  Company  has  not  realized  any  significant  losses  on  its  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable"
"securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations"
and financial condition.
