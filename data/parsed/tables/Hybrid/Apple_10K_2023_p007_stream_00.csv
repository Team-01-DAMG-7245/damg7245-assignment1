Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The  Company  has  historically  experienced  higher  net  sales  in  its  first  quarter  compared  to  other  quarters  in  its  fiscal  year  due  in  part  to  seasonal  holiday
"demand. Additionally,  new  product  and  service  introductions  can  significantly  impact  net  sales,  cost  of  sales  and  operating  expenses.  The  timing  of  product"
introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product
"launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers"
and distributors anticipate a product introduction.
