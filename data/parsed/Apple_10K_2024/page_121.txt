If the Committee determines a Covered Executive Received erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation, the
Committee shall determine the timing and method of recovery in its sole direction and direct Apple to recover any
erroneously awarded amounts as soon as administratively practicable. The methods of recovery include but are not
limited to, requiring reimbursement from the Covered Executive, electing to withhold or suspend unpaid Incentive-Based
Compensation, by offset (subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”) if applicable), forcing the sale of shares issued pursuant to Incentive-Based Compensation,
rescinding, cancelling, or otherwise causing the forfeiture of any unvested or unpaid Incentive-Based Compensation,
deducting from amounts otherwise payable to the Covered Executive including base salary, commissions, time-based
equity awards or other compensation, or by requiring incremental payments from the Covered Executive using one or
more of the above methods or any other methods authorized by applicable law.
Apple shall not indemnify any Covered Executive for the loss of any Incentive-Based Compensation or the cost of any
third-party insurance to cover the same.

Apple policy, including the Apple Inc. Executive Team Compensation Recoupment Policy, any applicable plan,
agreement, other arrangement, or otherwise, including, but not limited to, termination of employment, initiation of other
disciplinary procedures, and/or the institution of civil or criminal proceedings, provided however, if Incentive-Based
Compensation is recovered under this Policy it would not be subject to double recovery under any other Apple policy,
