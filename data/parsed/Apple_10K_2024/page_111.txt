Restricted Trading Periods and Trading Windows
A restricted trading period is a specified period of time during which designated Apple personnel, and their covered family members and
entities, may not buy or sell Apple securities. If you are subject to trading restrictions, you will be notified by Apple’s Corporate Legal team.
A trading window (sometimes referred to as an “open trading window”) is a specified period of time during which Apple personnel may buy or
sell Apple securities, so long as the individual is not aware of material nonpublic information. Complying with restricted trading periods and
trading windows may protect you and Apple from regulatory investigations or insider trading allegations. However, even if you are not subject
to restricted trading periods or no such period is in effect, you must not trade in Apple securities if you are aware of material nonpublic
information about Apple.
The regularly scheduled restricted trading period and trading window for each quarter is indicated below.

Legal team. If you are notified about a special or extended restricted trading period, you should not discuss it with others.
