The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax years after 2017 for
the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution or closure of
examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease between approximately
$5 billion and $13 billion in the next 12 months, primarily related to intercompany transfer pricing and deemed repatriation tax.
