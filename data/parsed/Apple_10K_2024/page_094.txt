with the schedule set forth in the Grant Notice and Section 8(d)), without regard to the Participant’s Termination of Service, determined by
multiplying (i) the number of RSUs eligible to vest on the applicable Vesting Date, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
days that have elapsed between the Award Date and the Participant’s Retirement date, and the denominator of which shall be the total number
of days contained in the period between the Award Date and the applicable Vesting Date. For purposes of this Award Agreement, “Retirement”
means the Participant’s Termination of Service on or after the Participant both has reached the age of sixty (60) and has completed ten (10)
years of service with the Company, or any Subsidiary (including service with any entity acquired by the Company) as of the Severance Date, as
determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. In the event the Participant’s Termination of Service occurs prior to the first anniversary of
the Award Date, this Section 8(b) shall not apply, unless the Committee shall otherwise determine in its sole discretion. For purposes of this
Section 8(b), a Termination of Service shall not include the Participant’s Termination of Service resulting from the Participant’s Disability or death
(in which case Section 8(c) or 8(d), as applicable, will apply).
(c) In the event of the Participant’s Termination of Service due to the Participant’s Disability, any unvested RSUs shall continue
to be eligible to vest in full (in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Grant Notice and Section 8(d)) without regard to the Participant’s
Termination of Service.
(d) In the event of the Participant’s Termination of Service due to the Participant’s death, all unvested RSUs eligible to vest on
Vesting Date(s) subsequent to the Participant’s death shall accelerate and vest immediately, and upon the Participant’s death following the
Participant’s Termination of Service due to Disability or Retirement any RSUs that were eligible to vest in full, or pro rata in the case of
Retirement, will be settled as soon as administratively practicable after the Participant’s death in accordance with Section 7.
(e) If any unvested RSUs are terminated hereunder, such RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall
automatically terminate and be canceled as of the applicable Severance Date without payment of any consideration by the Company and without
any other action by the Participant or the Participant’s beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be.
9. Recoupment. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be
issued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of
any such Shares or property, shall be subject to any recoupment, “clawback” or similar provisions of Applicable Laws relevant to the Company’s
Shares and any recoupment, “clawback” or similar policy maintained by the Company from time to time. In addition, the Company may require
the Participant to deliver or otherwise repay to the Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued,
delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any such
Shares or property, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more of the following has occurred:
(a) during the period of the Participant’s employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
“Employment Period”), the Participant has committed a felony (under the laws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or
offense under the applicable laws of any relevant foreign jurisdiction);
(b) during the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in a breach of
confidentiality, or an unauthorized disclosure or use of inside information, customer lists, trade secrets or other confidential information of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
