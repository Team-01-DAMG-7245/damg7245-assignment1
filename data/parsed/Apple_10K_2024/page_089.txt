PERFORMANCE AWARD
EXHIBIT A
PERFORMANCE VESTING REQUIREMENTS
The RSUs (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to the Award that will vest on the Vesting Date will be determined based on
the Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) Percentile for the Performance Period.
The percentage of the RSUs (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that vest on the Vesting Date will be determined as follows:
• If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile or greater, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target RSUs
will vest on the Vesting Date.
• If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target RSUs will vest on
the Vesting Date.
• If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target RSUs will vest on
the Vesting Date.
• If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is below the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the RSUs will vest on the
Vesting Date.
For TSR Percentile performance for the Performance Period between the levels indicated above, the portion of the RSUs that will vest
on the Vesting Date will be determined on a straight-line basis (i.e., linearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages indicated
above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company’s TSR for the Performance Period is negative, in no event shall more than one hundred
percent (100%) of the target RSUs vest.
The number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date will be rounded to the nearest whole unit, and the balance of the RSUs will not vest
and will terminate on that Vesting Date.
For purposes of the Award, the following definitions will apply:
• “TSR Percentile” means the percentile ranking of the Company’s TSR among the TSRs for the Comparison Group members for
the Performance Period. In determining the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period, in the event that the
Company’s TSR for the Performance Period is equal to the TSR(s) of one or more other Comparison Group members for that
same period, the Company’s TSR Percentile ranking will be determined by ranking the Company’s TSR for that period as being
greater than such other Comparison Group members.
• “Comparison Group” means the Company and each other company included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index on the first
day of the Performance Period and, except as provided below, the common stock (or similar equity security) of which continues
to be listed or traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day of the Performance Period. In the event a
member of the Comparison Group files for bankruptcy or liquidates due to an insolvency, such company shall continue to be
treated as a Comparison Group member, and such company’s Ending Price will be treated as $0 if the common stock (or similar
equity security) of such company is no longer listed or
