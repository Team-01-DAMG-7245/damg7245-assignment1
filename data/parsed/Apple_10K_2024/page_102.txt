RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall continue to be eligible to vest on the Vesting Date without regard to the
Participant’s Termination of Service. For purposes of this Award Agreement, “Retirement” means the Participant’s Termination of Service on or
after the Participant both has reached the age of sixty (60) and has completed ten (10) years of service with the Company, or any Subsidiary
(including service with any entity acquired by the Company), as of the Severance Date, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. In
the event the Participant’s Termination of Service occurs due to Retirement prior to the first anniversary of the Award Date, this Section 8(b) shall
not apply, unless the Committee shall otherwise determine in its sole discretion.
(c) If any unvested RSUs are terminated hereunder, such RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall
automatically terminate and be canceled as of the applicable Severance Date (or, to the extent that any RSUs remain outstanding following the
Severance Date by reason of Section 8(b) but the applicable performance-based vesting conditions are not satisfied, such RSUs shall
automatically terminate and be canceled as of the Vesting Date, as provided in Exhibit A) without payment of any consideration by the Company
and without any other action by the Participant, or the Participant’s beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be.
9. Recoupment. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be
issued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of
any such Shares or property, shall be subject to any recoupment, “clawback” or similar provisions of Applicable Laws relevant to the Company’s
Shares and any recoupment, “clawback” or similar policy maintained by the Company from time to time. In addition, the Company may require
the Participant to deliver or otherwise repay to the Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued,
delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any such
Shares or property, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more of the following has occurred:
(a) during the period of the Participant’s employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
“Employment Period”), the Participant has committed a felony (under the laws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or
offense under the applicable laws of any relevant foreign jurisdiction);
(b) during the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in a breach of
confidentiality, or an unauthorized disclosure or use of inside information, customer lists, trade secrets or other confidential information of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(c) during the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in an act of theft,
embezzlement or fraud, or materially breached any agreement to which the Participant is a party with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
For purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to issue instructions, on the Participant’s
behalf, to any brokerage firm and/or third party administrator holding the Participant’s Shares and/or other amounts acquired under the Plan to
re-convey, transfer or otherwise return such Shares and/or other amounts to the Company. By accepting this Award, the Participant further
agrees to comply with any request or demand for repayment by the Company in order to comply with such policies or Applicable Laws. To the
extent that the terms of this Agreement and any Company recoupment policy conflict, the terms of the recoupment policy shall prevail. This
Section 9 is not the Company’s exclusive remedy with respect to such matters.
10. Adjustments Upon Specified Events. Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company’s stock contemplated by
Section 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in
accordance with
