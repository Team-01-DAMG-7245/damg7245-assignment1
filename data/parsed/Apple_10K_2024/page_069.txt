If we consolidate or merge with or into any other person or sell, transfer, lease or convey all or substantially all of our properties and assets in
accordance with the Indentures, the Successor will be substituted for us in the Indentures, with the same effect as if it had been an original party to the
Indentures. As a result, the Successor may exercise our rights and powers under the Indentures, and we will be released from all our liabilities and obligations
under the Indentures and under the debt securities.
For purposes of this covenant, “person” means any individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, association, joint-stock
company, trust, unincorporated organization or government or any agency or political subdivision thereof or any other entity.
