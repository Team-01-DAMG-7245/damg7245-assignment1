DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES
The following description of the Notes is a summary and does not purport to be complete. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference, as
applicable, to the Indenture, dated as of April 29, 2013, between Apple Inc. and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “2013
Indenture”) and the Indenture, dated as of November 5, 2018, between Apple Inc. and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “2018
Indenture,” and together with the 2013 Indenture, the “Indentures”). References in this section to the “Company,” “us,” “we” and “our” are solely to Apple Inc. and
not to any of its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.
The Notes
Each of the Notes were issued under the applicable Indenture, which provides that debt securities may be issued under such Indenture from time to
time in one or more series. The Indentures and the Notes are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The Indentures
do not limit the amount of debt securities that we may issue thereunder. We may, without the consent of the holders of the debt securities of any series, issue
additional debt securities ranking equally with, and otherwise similar in all respects to, the debt securities of the series (except for the date of issuance, the date
interest begins to accrue and, in certain circumstances, the first interest payment date) so that those additional debt securities will be consolidated and form a
single series with the debt securities of the series previously offered and sold; provided, however, that any additional debt securities will have a separate ISIN
number unless certain conditions are met.
