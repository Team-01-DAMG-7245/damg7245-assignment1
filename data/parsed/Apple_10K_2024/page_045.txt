Note 8 – Leases

Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the
underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $2.0 billion for both 2024 and 2023 and $1.9
billion for 2022. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $13.8 billion, $13.9 billion and $14.9 billion for 2024, 2023 and

right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $1.0 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.8 billion for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
