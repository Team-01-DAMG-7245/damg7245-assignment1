“Comparable Government Bond Rate” means the price, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded
upwards), at which the gross redemption yield on the Notes, if they were to be purchased at such price on the third business day prior to the date fixed for
redemption, would be equal to the gross redemption yield on such business day of the Comparable Government Bond on the basis of the middle market price of
the Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such business day as determined by an independent investment bank selected by

Covenants
The Indentures set forth limited covenants that apply to the Notes. However, these covenants do not, among other things:
• limit the amount of indebtedness or lease obligations that may be incurred by us and our subsidiaries;
• limit our ability or that of our subsidiaries to issue, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens; or
• restrict us from paying dividends or making distributions on our capital stock or purchasing or redeeming our capital stock.
Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets
The Indentures provide that we may consolidate with or merge with or into any other person, and may sell, transfer, or lease or convey all or
substantially all of our properties and assets to another person; provided that the following conditions are satisfied:
• we are the continuing entity, or the resulting, surviving or transferee person (the “Successor”) is a person (if such person is not a corporation, then
the Successor will include a corporate co-issuer of the debt securities) organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any
state thereof or the District of Columbia and the Successor (if not us) will expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, all of our obligations under
the debt securities and the applicable Indenture and, for each security that by its terms provides for conversion, provide for the right to convert such
security in accordance with its terms;
• immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no default or event of default under the applicable Indenture has occurred and is continuing; and
• in the case of the 2013 Indenture, the trustee receives from us an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel that the transaction and such
supplemental indenture, as the case may be, complies with the applicable provisions of the 2013 Indenture.
