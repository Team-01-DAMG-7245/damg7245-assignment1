In addition to the above prohibitions, this policy includes important additional information.
“Material” Nonpublic Information
Determining whether information is “material” requires consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. In general, information is
material if it would likely be considered important by an investor who is deciding whether to buy or sell a security, or if the information is likely
to have a significant effect on the market price of the security. Both positive and negative information may be material. “Materiality” is different
for different companies. Information that is not material to Apple may be material to another company.
“Nonpublic” Information
“Nonpublic” information means information that has not been previously disclosed to the general public and is otherwise not available to the
general public. Information should be considered nonpublic for at least 24 hours after it has been distributed to the general public through a
press release, filing with the SEC, or similar means. The circulation of rumors, even if accurate and reported in the media, is not considered
effective public distribution.
Policy Violations
Apple personnel who violate this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment and repayment of
equity awards. Additionally, individuals who engage in illegal insider trading or tipping can be liable for substantial criminal and civil
penalties.
If you have any doubt whether information is public or material, or have questions about this policy, consult Apple’s team by emailing
[***] or calling [***].
