11. Responsibility for Taxes. The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action the Company and/or the Participant’s
employer (“Employer”) take with respect to any Tax-Related Items, the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant’s
responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that
the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection
with any aspect of the Award, including the grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any
Shares acquired at vesting, and the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no
obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or
achieve any particular tax result. Further, if the Participant is or becomes subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant
acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-
Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make arrangements satisfactory to the
Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or
their respective agents, at their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as they may specify from time to time, to satisfy any applicable
withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:
(a) withholding from any wages or other cash compensation payable to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer;
(b) withholding otherwise deliverable Shares and/or from otherwise payable Dividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid
upon vesting/settlement of the Award;
(c) arranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the Participant’s behalf and at the Participant’s
direction pursuant to this authorization), including selling Shares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan;
(d) withholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the Award; or
(e) any other method of withholding determined by the Company to be permitted under the Plan and, to the extent required by
Applicable Law or under the Plan, approved by the Committee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is an officer of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, then
the Company must satisfy any withholding obligations arising upon the occurrence of a taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable,
by withholding Shares otherwise deliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant to method
(b), unless the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of
methods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above.
The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory withholding amounts or other withholding rates,
including maximum rates applicable in the Participant’s jurisdiction(s). If the maximum rate is used, any over-withheld amount may be refunded
to the Participant in cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or if not refunded, the Participant may seek
a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items
directly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number
of Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested
RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back
