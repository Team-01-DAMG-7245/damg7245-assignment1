The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally
uses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from
contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to
the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of
September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would
be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.
