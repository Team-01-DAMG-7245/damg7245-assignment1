(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given for 60 days by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding debt securities of such series.
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of a series will have the right, subject to certain limitations, to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee with respect to the debt securities of that series or
exercising any trust or power conferred to the trustee, and to waive certain defaults. Each of the Indentures provides that if an event of default occurs and is
continuing, the trustee will exercise such of its rights and powers under such Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent
person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person’s own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the trustee will be under no
obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the applicable Indenture at the request of any of the holders of the debt securities of a series unless they
will have offered to the trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in
compliance with such request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any debt security will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive payment of the principal of and
premium, if any, and interest on that debt security on or after the due dates expressed in that debt security and to institute suit for the enforcement of payment.
Modification and Waivers
Modification and amendments of the Indentures and the Notes may be made by us and the trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding series of Notes affected thereby; provided, however, that no such modification or amendment may,
without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Note of that series affected thereby:
• change the stated maturity of the principal of, or installment of interest on, any Note;
• reduce the principal amount of any Note or reduce the amount of the principal of any Note which would be due and payable upon a declaration of
acceleration of the maturity thereof or reduce the rate of interest on any Note;
• reduce any premium payable on the redemption of any Note or change the date on which any Note may or must be redeemed (in the case of the
2018 Indenture, it being understood that a change to any notice requirement with respect to such date shall not be deemed to be a change of such
date);
• change the coin or currency in which the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note is payable;
• impair the right of any holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the stated maturity of any Note (or, in the case of
redemption, on or after the redemption date);
• reduce the percentage in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, the consent of whose holders is required in order to take certain actions;
• reduce the requirements for quorum or voting by holders of Notes in the applicable Indenture or the Note;
• modify any of the provisions in the applicable Indenture regarding the waiver of past defaults and the waiver of certain covenants by the holders of
Notes except to increase any percentage vote required or to provide that certain other provisions of the applicable Indenture cannot be modified or
waived without the consent of the holder of each Notes affected thereby;
• make any change that adversely affects the right to convert or exchange any debt security or decreases the conversion or exchange rate or
increases the conversion price of any convertible or exchangeable debt security, unless such decrease or increase is permitted by the terms of the
debt securities; or
• modify any of the above provisions.
