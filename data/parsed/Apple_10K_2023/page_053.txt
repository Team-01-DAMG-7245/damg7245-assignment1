How We Addressed the
Matter in Our Audit
We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management’s
assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to
measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures.
To evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit
procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as
applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the
uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of
Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing
authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the
matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s disclosure in
relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial statements.
