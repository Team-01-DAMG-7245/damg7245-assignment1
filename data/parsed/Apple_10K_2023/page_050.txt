Note 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,
Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and
Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the
Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is
managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic
region.
The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally
based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment
consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the
Company’s chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.
